Jupyter notebook implementation different zero-knowledge proof-systems and
techniques in Python.

The goal of this project is to have an interactive environment where people
interested in zero-knowledge proof technologies can learn interactively.
The whole notebook would be made using custom implementations, from finite
fields to proof systems and recursion techniques. It would also cover
cryptographic primitives like AO hash functions, standard hash functions,
lookup techniques, folding schemes, etc.

The notebook would be using [py-keum](https://github.com/dannywillems/py-keum/).

NB: I might not have time to continue this project. If you think it has a huge
community value, please let me know, ping me and motivate me to continue. It
would be a pleasure to work on it.
